"DESCRIPTION":

TEXT FILE PROGRAM:
THIS JAVA PROGRAM IS TO PERFORM BASIC FILE OPERATIONS LIKE READING, WRITING, AND MODIFYING TEXT FILES. THE PROGRAM IS LIKE A SIMPLE MENU-DRIVEN GIVE US TO SELECT OPTIONS TO PERFORM FEATURES LIKE:
1. READ FILE: READS THE CONTENTS FROM THE PATH WHICH I HAVE GIVEN.
2. WRITE FILE: WRITES TEXT TO A SPECIFIED TEXT FILE.
3. MODIFY FILE: REPLACES SPECIFIED TEXT IN A FILE WITH NEW TEXT.

CLASSES AND METHODS
FILE CLASS: CONTAINS THE MAIN METHOD,  THIS CLASS ALSO DEFINES THE PROGRAM'S MENU-DRIVEN WHICH MENTIONED ABOVE.
READFILE METHOD: READS THE CONTENTS OF A SPECIFIED TEXT FILE USING A BUFFEREDREADER.SCANNER IS USED TO GIVE THE PATH IN THIS METHOD.
WRITEFILE METHOD: WRITES USER-PROVIDED TEXT TO A SPECIFIED TEXT FILE USING A BUFFEREDWRITER. THIS METHOD ALSO TAKES A SCANNER OBJECT AS A PARAMETER TO READ USER INPUT.
MODIFYFILE METHOD: REPLACES SPECIFIED TEXT IN A FILE WITH NEW TEXT PROVIDED BY THE USER. THIS METHOD USES A BUFFEREDREADER AND BUFFEREDWRITER TO READ AND WRITE THE FILE.

LIBRARIES AND IMPORTS
-JAVA.IO.*
- JAVA.UTIL.SCANNER

- HOW IT WORKS:

1. YOU CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
2. YOU ENTER THE FILE NAME.
3. YOU ENTER THE TEXT YOU WANT TO WRITE OR MODIFY.

WHY USE THIS PROGRAM?
THIS PROGRAM DEMONSTRATES BASIC FILE OPERATIONS IN JAVA AND CAN BE USED FOR SIMPLE TEXT FILE MANAGEMENT TASKS. IT SHOWCASES THE USE OF BUFFEREDREADER AND BUFFEREDWRITER FOR EFFICIENT FILE READING AND WRITING. THE PROGRAM'S MENU-DRIVEN INTERFACE MAKES IT EASY TO USE, EVEN FOR THOSE WITHOUT EXTENSIVE PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE.

- READING AND DISPLAYING FILE: THE PROGRAM CAN BE USED TO READ AND DISPLAY THE CONTENTS OF A FILE, SUCH AS A PROPERTIES FILE OR AN XML FILE.
- WRITING USER INPUT TO A LOG FILE: THE PROGRAM CAN BE USED TO WRITE USER INPUT TO A LOG FILE, SUCH AS A TEXT FILE OR A CSV FILE.
- MODIFYING A TEXT FILE TO REPLACE PLACEHOLDER VALUES WITH ACTUAL DATA: THE PROGRAM CAN BE USED TO MODIFY A TEXT FILE TO REPLACE PLACEHOLDER VALUES WITH ACTUAL DATA, SUCH AS REPLACING PLACEHOLDERS IN A TEMPLATE FILE WITH ACTUAL VALUES.

BENEFITS
1. EASY TO USE.
2. WORKS FAST.
3. HELPS YOU MANAGE TEXT FILES.

WE CAN ALSO WRITE THE PROGRAM WITHOUT MENU-DRIVEN ALSO.
FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY I TOOK IT.
